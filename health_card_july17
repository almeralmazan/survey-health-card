The fact that employees health may also be at risk especially during coverages, will the agency consider including this as one of our benefits from the agency? (Baka pwede pong i-shoulder na ng PIA)
2. How far/who will also be covered by this healthcard, will our immediate family be included/covered by this in just one card under the employees account/name?
3. Is it easily accessible anytime, anywhere? Like kung halimbawa emergency cases, tapos nakalimutan mong dalhin yung card mo, pwede bang sabihan mo lang yung HMO name, account name. Pwede na nilang i-check online kung active account para magamit mo pa rin?
4. Is it a health card na accredited in different regions/provinces nationwide or even international?"
